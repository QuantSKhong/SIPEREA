## SIPEREA

We created SIPEREA, a scalable imaging platform utilizing cost-effective ESP32-CAMs. SIPEREA includes three GUI-based applications: (1) an embedded program on the ESP32-CAM for image capture, (2) an image acquisition program that facilitates automated wireless transmission of images from multiple ESP32-CAMs, and (3) an image analysis program that calculates organismal areas from the captured images. The system leverages asynchronous sequential imaging to efficiently manage numerous ESP32-CAMs simultaneously.
